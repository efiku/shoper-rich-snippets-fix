# shoper-rich-snippets-fix

As you already know, since a long time online shops based on Shoper platform have a little problem With Google Rich
Snippets on Products page

## The Problem

1. Problem occurs when you want to add more comments to your product than 1.
2. In Google Search Console you should see Errors with structural data `Product` - AggregateRating

## The Solution

For now, only workaround is to redesign whole Structural data information and move it, at the beginning of comments
section.



### Structural data tool:

 - [Google Rich Result Tool](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
 - [Advanced SEO - Google Documentation - Product](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/product)
